This is a set of scripts designed to send microphone audio from a low performance computer, but with a microphone to a high performance computer or server for running speech recognition there and send the results to another component.
   
The project is coded as a workaround to get a local, good and especially fast speech recognition for the humanoid robot pepper.
For this the client scripts need to be Python 2 compatible.

The vosk based Version works perfectly fine, but the whisper version is for now just some unsuccessful trying around.
